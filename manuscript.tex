\begin{abstract}
The power, size, and weight constraints of micro air vehicles (MAVs) limit 
their on-board sensing and computational resources. Ground vehicles have 
less mobility than MAVs, but relaxed size constraints and typically more 
computing power, creating opportunities for cooperation. In this work, we 
demonstrate cooperative target-seeking between a 13 gram ornithopter MAV 
and a lightweight ground station using computer vision.

We also introduce a new ornithopter MAV, the 13 gram H$^2$Bird. It 
features clap and fling wings, improves upon a previous design by 
utilizing a carbon fiber airframe, tail rotor, and elevator, and carries a 
payload of 2.8 grams. We augment the ornithopter's built-in 
gyroscope-based control with a ground station, which has power and weight 
requirements appropriate for deployment on a ground vehicle. The ground 
station provides heading estimates to the ornithoper by running a 
real-time motion tracking algorithm on a live video stream. This allows 
the ornithopter to reliably negotiate flight through narrow openings.

We demonstrate the performance of the location estimation and navigation 
algorithms. We model the backwards-reachable region for successfully 
navigating through narrow openings. Finally, we verify this model through 
with collected in experiments with window traversal.

\section{Introduction}
%TODO(ryan)
The power, size, and weight constraints of micro air vehicle (MAV) 
platforms significantly limit on-board sensing and computational 
resources, and thus the complexity of the control and state estimation 
algorithms which can be executed on-board. These constraints are 
particularly severe for flapping wing MAVs offer the promise of superior 
safety, efficiency, and noise profile to rotor craft MAVs, but at the 
expense of payload weight.

\subsection{H$^2$Bird Ornithoper MAV}
%TODO(humphrey)
The flying platform used in this experiment is the H$^2$Bird flapping wing 
MAV. Built around the Silverlit I-Bird RC flyer powertrain and clap-fling 
wings, the H$^2$Bird has a wingspan of [40?] cm and weighs [14?] grams 
fully loaded. A tail propeller and servo-controlled tail elevator provide 
control in the yaw and pitch axes. An onboard electronics package combines 
a 40 MIPS microprocessor, 6 DOF IMU, 802.15.4 radio, VGA camera, and motor 
drivers with a 90 mAh lithium polymer battery for autonomous flight. In 
routine flight, the H$^2$Bird averages [insert speed] m/s ground speed and 
can operate for approximately [10] minutes.

\end{figure}

Rudimentary attitude control for the H$^2$Bird runs on-board. It estimates 
pose by naively integrating the IMU and depending on PID for control. The 
simplistic nature of our state estimation and control is due to the 
stringent resource constraints applied by the platform.

We use simple controllers to actuate the H$^2$Bird's wing beat frequency, 
tail rotor, and tail elevator, which we designed to actuate thrust, yaw, 
and pitch respectively.

Due to the high pitch angles experienced by the H$^2$Bird, we use a 
quaternion representation of vehicle pose to avoid the numerical 
instabilities of Euler angle representations. This choice of pose 
representation also lends itself well to remote guidance, as relative body 
and world coordinate angular displacements can be represented compactly 
with quaternion multiplication.  

Given a reference pose $q$, we define the error $q_e$ as the rotation 
required to reach the reference pose from the measured pose. We then 
linearize the error quaternion to produce body axis angular errors as as 
inputs to the attitude controllers. 

Three independent proportional-integral-derivative controllers commanding 
the wing thrust, elevator, and tail propeller. We use this independent PID 
controller architecture for simplicity in tuning and implementation, and 
because it demonstrates acceptable performance in the absence of a system 
model.

\begin{equation}
\label{quat_error}
q_e = q'\otimes q_r
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{quat_angle}
\alpha = 2acos(q_{e,w})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{quat_linearize}
Q_e = \alpha*q_e/sin(\alpha /2)

We determined the turning speed and turning radius of the H$^2$Bird 
experimentally using the response of the system to the input of a 90 
degree turn to the right. The results of this experiment are depicted in 
Figure \ref{fig:step_response}. The data for the experiment was gathered 
from the gyro data integrated on-board the H$^2$Bird. We used Matlab to 
fit a simple low-order model, $H(s) = \frac{0.94782}{1+0.61998s}$, of the 
turning system to the step response with the physical heading as the state 
and the heading setpoint as the input. We use this model in Section X to 
determine the backwards reachable set for navigating through the window in 
simulation.

The step response exhibits a rise time of approximately 1.4 seconds. The H
$^2$Bird flies at an average forward velocity of 1.2 m/s, so the estimated 
minimum turning radius of the robot is 1.07 meters.

We determined the backwards reachable set of initial states for sussessful 
window traversal both geometrically and in simulation. The results are 
shown in Figure X. The geometrically infeasible region is indicated in 
blue and was computed using the minimum turning radius and simple 
geometery. Both the regions in red and blue indicate the infeasible region 
determined in simulation. We executed the simulation on the fitted turning 
model described in Section \ref{sec:flight_control}, with a PID controller 
steering the system to the center of the window as the input. The 
infeasible region calculated in simulation is a superset of the 
geometrically infeasible region, and is closer to the true infeasible 
region of the real system.
