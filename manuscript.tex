%TODO(ryan)
The power, size, and weight constraints of micro air vehicle (MAV) platforms limit their on-board sensing and computational resources. In this work, we demonstrate cooperative control of a 14 gram ornithopter MAV by a lightweight ground station using computer vision. We also introduce a new ornithopter MAV platform, the h$^2$Bird, which...

\section{Introduction}
%TODO(ryan)
The power, size, and weight constraints of micro air vehicle (MAV) platforms significantly limit on-board sensing and computational resources, and thus the complexity of the control and state estimation algorithms which can be executed on-board. These constraints are particularly severe for flapping wing MAVs offer the promise of superior safety, efficiency, and noise profile to rotor craft MAVs, but at the expense of payload weight.

We use simple controllers to actuate the h$^2$Bird's wing beat frequency, tail rotor, and tail elevator, which we designed to actuate thrust, yaw, and pitch respectively. Due to the high pitch angles experienced by the h$^2$Bird, we use a quaternion representation of vehicle attitude to avoid the numerical instabilities of Euler angle representations. Given a reference attitude $q$, we define the error $q_e$ as the rotation required to reach the reference attitude from the measured attitude. We then linearize the error quaternion to produce body axis angular errors. Three independent proportional-integral-derivative controllers commanding the wing thrust, elevator, and tail propeller. We use this independent PID controller architecture for simplicity in tuning and implementation, and because it demonstrates acceptable performance in the absence of a system model.
