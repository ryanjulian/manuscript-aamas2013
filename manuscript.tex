\addtolength{\textheight}{-0cm}
                        % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                        % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                        % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                        % This command does not take effect until the next page
                        % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                        % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
