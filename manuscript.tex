% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
The power, size, and weight constraints of micro air vehicles (MAVs) limit 
their on-board sensing and computational resources. Ground vehicles have 
less mobility than MAVs, but relaxed size constraints and typically more 
computing power, creating opportunities for cooperation. In this work, we 
demonstrate cooperative target-seeking between a 13 gram ornithopter MAV 
and a lightweight ground station using computer vision.

We also introduce a new ornithopter MAV, the 13 gram H$^2$Bird. It 
features clap and fling wings, improves upon a previous design by 
utilizing a carbon fiber airframe, tail rotor, and elevator, and carries a 
payload of 2.8 grams. We augment the ornithopter's built-in 
gyroscope-based control with a ground station, which has power and weight 
requirements appropriate for deployment on 30 gram a ground vehicle. The ground 
station provides heading estimates to the ornithoper by running a 
real-time motion tracking algorithm on a live video stream. This allows 
the ornithopter to reliably negotiate flight through narrow openings.

We demonstrate the performance of the location estimation and navigation 
algorithms. We model the backwards-reachable region for successfully 
navigating through narrow openings. Finally, we verify this model through 
with collected in experiments with window traversal.

\section{Introduction}
%TODO(ryan)
The power, size, and weight constraints of micro air vehicle (MAV) 
platforms significantly limit on-board sensing and computational 
resources, and thus the complexity of the control and state estimation 
algorithms which can be executed on-board. These constraints are 
particularly severe for flapping wing MAVs, a class of MAVs that have inherently superior 
safety, efficiency, and noise profile to rotor craft MAVs, but at the 
expense of payload weight.

\subsection{H$^2$Bird Ornithoper MAV}
%TODO(humphrey)
The flying platform used in this experiment is the H$^2$Bird flapping wing 
MAV. Built around the Silverlit I-Bird RC flyer power train and clap-fling 
wings, the H$^2$Bird has a wingspan of [40?] cm and has a flight weight of 
13 grams. A tail propeller and servo-controlled tail elevator provide 
control in the yaw and pitch axes. The on-board electronics package consists of 
a 40 MIPS microprocessor, 6 DOF IMU, IEEE 802.15.4 radio, VGA camera, and motor 
drivers with a 90 mAh lithium polymer battery. In routine flight, the H$^2$Bird 
averages [1.2 m/s] and can operate for approximately 10 minutes.

\end{figure}

Attitude estimation and control for the H$^2$Bird runs on-board to achieve 
acceptable tracking performance. We estimate the vehicle pose by naively
integrating the IMU, and use PID for controlling the vehicle. The simplistic 
nature of our approach arises from the stringent resource constraints 
of our platform, but nonetheless is not a completely trivial implementation.

One characteristic of the H$^2$Bird that separates it from other MAVs is the
high pitch angles experienced in routine flight. An Euler angle 
parameterization of the vehicle orientation would suffer from singularities
around these high pitch angles, so we instead represent the vehicle orientation
with quaternions. An additional benefit of the quaternion representation is 
the ability to represent relative body and world coordinate angular displacements 
compactly with quaternion multiplication.%~\cite{bowman:reasoning} 

Given a reference quaternion $q$, we define the error $q_e$ as the rotation 
required to reach the reference pose from the measured pose. We then 
convert this error quaternion to an angle axis representation which is given
as an input to the PID controller. 

\begin{equation}
\label{quat_error}
q_e = q'\otimes q_r
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{quat_angle}
\alpha = 2acos(q_{e,w})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{quat_linearize}
Q_e = \alpha*q_e/sin(\alpha /2)

\section{Performance}
%TODO cameron

To judge the performance of our system described in the previous sections, we
determined the feasible set of initial conditions that resulted in successful
window traversal. We then conducted experiments to calculate the success rate
both within the feasible region and on the edges of the feasible region. The
following sections detail how we calculated the feasible and infeasible
regions using system identification and present the results of our
experimental trials.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/step_response_total.pdf}
\caption{H$^2$Bird step response}
\label{fig:step_response}
\end{figure}

We determined the turning speed and turning radius of the H$^2$Bird
experimentally using the response of the system to the step input of a
clockwise 90 degree turn. The results of this experiment are depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:step_response}. The data for the experiment was gathered from
the integration of the H$^2$Bird's on-board gyroscope data. We used Matlab to
fit a simple low-order model, $H(s) = \frac{0.94782}{1+0.61998s}$, of the
turning behavior to the step response with the physical heading as the state
and the heading set point as the input. This model serves as a simplification
of both the turning dynamics of the ornithopter and the on-board PID
controller regulating the actuator inputs to reach the desired orientation. We
use this model in Section~\ref{sec:visual_servoing} to determine the backwards
reachable region for navigating through the window in simulation.
\\
The step response has a rise time of approximately 1.4 seconds. The H$^2$Bird
flies at an average forward velocity of 1.2 m/s, so the estimated minimum
turning radius of the robot is 1.07 meters. This flight speed is slower than
the maximum speed of the ornithopter to facilitate more reliable tracking.

\end{figure*}

We determined the backwards reachable set of initial states for successful
window traversal both geometrically and in simulation. The results are shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:feasible_set}. For the initial conditions, we used a
spatial grid of 0.05 meter increments within the camera viewing region and an
initial angular position perpendicular to the window plane. The geometrically
infeasible region is indicated in blue and was computed using the minimum
turning radius and simple geometry. Both the regions in red and blue indicate
the infeasible region determined in simulation. We simulated the turning
model, described in Section~\ref{sec:flight_control}, with a PID controller
steering the system to the center of the window as the input. The infeasible
region calculated in simulation is a superset of the geometrically infeasible
region. The simulation is more realistic as the rotational damping during the
turn and the on-board PID controller cause the real system to react to inputs
at a non-constant angular velocity.
\\
To verify the feasible region experimentally, we conducted trials at initial
distances in approximately 0.4 meter increments from the window along the
edges of the camera image frame. We began each trial with an initial heading
perpendicular to the window plane. The results of the experiments are shown in
Figures~\ref{fig:flight_paths} and~\ref{fig:flight_paths_feasible}.
\\
For initial conditions in the middle of the feasible region and in front of
the camera, we achieved a success rate of 79\%. This case is depicted in
Figure~\ref{fig:flight_paths_feasible}. As we moved towards the edges of the
feasible region in Figure~\ref{fig:flight_paths}, the success rate diminishes
because of several factors. On the edges of the camera frame, the yaw control
inputs are large in magnitude, although this is not necessary in all cases.
Since the control algorithm we are using has no notion of depth, it applies
the same control input whether the ornithopter is close to the camera, where
small changes in heading are adequate, or far away from the camera, where
large changes in heading are necessary. Due to this phenomenon, the controller
often over- or under-compensates in certain regions, depending upon the PID
tuning and the distance from the camera. Tracking noise can also cause the
window navigation to fail.
